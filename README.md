# hard
[![experimental][stability-image]][stability-url]

Sort of like [verb](https://github.com/assemble/verb) but using [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble) and [handlebars](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js) to achieve results.

## Why?

I love assemble and want to find more uses for it. HARD allows for exploration of areas which I would not persue with an assemble static site workflow. 
HARD is not meant to be a replacement for verb and does not seek a parity match of features. It is only a proof of concept.

## Installation
```sh
$ npm install akileez\hard
```

## Usage
```js

```

## API
```js

```
